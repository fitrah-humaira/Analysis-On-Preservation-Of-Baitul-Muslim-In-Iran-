**Analysis on Preservation of Baitul Muslim in Iran**

👋 About This Project

Welcome to our group project repository! In this study, we dove into a socially significant issue: the rising divorce rates in Iran. With divorce rates hitting as high as 61% in some provinces, we wanted to see if Data Science could help.

Our goal was to assist Baitul Muslim (a community institution guiding Islamic marriages) by identifying the root causes of marital breakdown. We built a Machine Learning model to predict divorce probability based on factors like education, age gap, and financial stability.

This project aligns with SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) by promoting family stability as a foundation for a resilient society.


🛠️ The Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (SVM, GridSearchCV, Isolation Forest)
- Statistics: SciPy

📊 Dataset & Methodology

We utilized the Marriage and Divorce Dataset from Kaggle, which contains 31 distinct features describing various aspects of a couple's relationship.

Our Process:
- Data Augmentation: To fix the small sample size, we generated synthetic data using Gaussian noise, increasing our samples from 100 to 300 to prevent overfitting.
- Cleaning: We checked for null values and duplicates (the data was surprisingly clean!).
- Outlier Detection: We used Isolation Forest to remove anomalies, ensuring our model trained on high-quality data.
- Feature Selection: Using Pearson Correlation, we selected the top 10 features that impact divorce, including Education, Good Income, Addiction, and Love.

🧠 The Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

We tested three different SVM kernels to see which fits the data best: Linear, Polynomial, and RBF. We optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation.

The Winner? 🏆 The Linear Kernel performed the best. It turns out the relationship between our features and divorce probability is largely linear


🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ' pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn scipy '
3. Make sure the dataset Marriage_Divorce_DB.csv (or the augmented version generated by the code) is in the same directory.
4. Run the cells to see the cleaning, EDA, and model training in action!

🔮 Future Work

- Expand the Data: Collect local data from Malaysia to compare cultural differences.
- Try New Models: Experiment with XGBoost or Deep Learning to see if we can beat 95%.
- Build an App: Develop a web-based tool for Baitul Muslim counselors to input couple data and get a risk assessment instantly.
